I hereby attach a draft of the system I would like you to develop for me, pls.

You can use either MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle as the database management system.
The system should be part of a financial management system where branches are in regions and each branch is managed by a manager.
Managers can be transferred from one branch to another and the system should keep the transfer history of the manager.

The system should have the following reports:
List of managers
List managers by gender
List of manager that have been transferred within a given period – e.g. from 1st January 2020 to 30th March 2020.
The reports be on the company letterhead.

The system should be able generate a query like ‘who is the manager in a given branch’?
